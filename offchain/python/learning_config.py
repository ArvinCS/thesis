Learning Configuration for Huffman Optimization

This module provides easy configuration switching between different learning modes:
1. Daily learning (rebuild once per day)
2. Immediate learning (rebuild after every verification)
3. Batch learning (rebuild after N verifications)
4. Hybrid learning (immediate for small changes, batched for larger ones)
